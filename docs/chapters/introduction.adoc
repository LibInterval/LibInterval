== Introduction

`com.github.jrybak2312.siderian.Interval` represents interval between two inclusive endpoints or in *some cases interval
witch has gap(s)*. `Interval` supports values with type which implements both Comparable and Temporal. So it supports many types from
                   `java.time` package such as `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.YearMonth`, `java.time.LocalDateTime`...

It uses Guava ranges under the hood and contains implementation of common features for work with time intervals
 (see table of content).
